 * Plugin Name: OnionPress Name Sync
 * Description: Registers each new WordPress username with OnionHome as an
 *              onionname. Does NOT release names when users are deleted —
 *              a registered onionname stays claimed forever so that
 *              Wayback-Machine archives of that user's posts remain
 *              resolvable via onionpress.org/<onionname>. The tor
 *              container does the signing (it has the HS private key);
 *              this plugin just tells the tor container which user was
 *              created.
 * Version:     1.0
 * Network:     true

// out of the global directory.

// Once an onionname is registered with OnionHome it stays registered

 * The at-creation registration above is a single shot — if OnionHome or

 * and users created before this plugin shipped were never registered at
 * all. The server's register is idempotent (same address + same name =
 * 200 OK), so re-registering everyone daily is safe: it backfills missed
 * names, self-heals after outages, and refreshes last_seen_at so the
 * directory reflects which installs are alive.
 *
 * Scheduled on the main site only — every subsite runs this mu-plugin,
 * but user accounts are network-global, and the tor container's health
 * checks hit the main site every minute so its wp-cron fires reliably
 * even on an otherwise idle install.
