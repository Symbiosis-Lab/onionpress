# OnionPress security audit + emergency patch.
#
# Runs on every container start, after multisite init. Two jobs:
#
#   1. PATCH  — pull WordPress core up to the latest security release now,
#               rather than waiting for the twice-daily wp_version_check
#               cron. Users may have been stranded on a vulnerable core for
#               weeks (see below), so the first boot after upgrading must
#               not leave them exposed for another 12 hours.
#
#   2. AUDIT  — look for evidence that the box was already compromised
#               before we patched it. Patching does not evict an attacker
#               who is already resident.
#
# Every network request made here goes through the Tor SOCKS proxy via
# onionpress-core-update.php. Nothing in this script may talk to wordpress.org
# directly: a clearnet update check ties the user's real IP to an OnionPress
# install, which is the one thing this project exists to avoid.
#
# Why this exists: builds through v2.4.107 shipped
# AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED=true + WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE=false, and the
# compose file pins the WordPress image by digest. Together those left
# installs with no route to a core security release. wp2shell
# (CVE-2026-63030 + CVE-2026-60137) is an unauthenticated RCE against
# WordPress 6.9.0-6.9.4 and 7.0.0-7.0.1, added to CISA KEV on 2026-07-21
# and exploited in the wild. Affected OnionPress users could not receive
# 7.0.2 even though WordPress.org force-pushed it.
#
# Remediation policy is deliberately tiered by false-positive risk:
#   - auto-quarantine  ONLY exact known-malicious file hashes (no FP risk)
#   - report-only      heuristics (code patterns, suspicious dirs) and
#                      anything involving user accounts — never delete a
#                      user's own content or logins unattended
# Anything report-only is written to the report file and logged loudly for
# the human to action.
